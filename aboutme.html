          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hi there! My name is Matej Sefcik and I'm a 22 year old photographer
            and filmmaker based in New Jersey. I am originally from Slovakia,
            but my parents emigrated to the U.S. when I was very young and I've
            lived in New Jersey ever since.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When I was a little kid, I loved to record home videos with my
            friends. Little did I know, it would turn into something I would end
            up pursuing as a career. It wasn't until college when I discovered
            what I truly loved, and that was being behind the camera, and I
            ended up graduating from Seton Hall University with a degree in
            Visual/Sound Media with a concentration in Film Production.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Not only do I love film, but my interest for photography grew as I
            gained more experience being behind the camera. I love to photograph
            anything that interests me, but my main focus is in cities and
            landscapes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Aside from my life behind the camera, I am an ice hockey and
            tennis fanatic, I've been playing guitar since I was 6, and I love
            to ski. Traveling and meeting new people along the way is a huge
            passion of mine as well.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I can create work in a range of different styles and I am confident
            I can provide a great finished product to a client, whether it be a
            small photoshoot or a large-scale video project. With that said, I
            hope to work with you soon!
